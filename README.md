# RQA Deforestation C-Scale Communit Use Case Pangeo-julia

This is the repository for the pangeo-julia C-Scale community use case. 
We try to scale the deforestation mapping using Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) to larger areas.

We are using the preprocessed Sentinel-1 data from the TU-Wien which is hosted on the EODC.
The data preprocessing is described in https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/22/4622.

The change detection approach that we investigate here is described in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9186165/
